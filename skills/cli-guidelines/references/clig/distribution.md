## Guidelines {#guidelines}

This is a collection of specific things you can do to make your command-line program better.

The first section contains the essential things you need to follow.
Get these wrong, and your program will be either hard to use or a bad CLI citizen.

The rest are nice-to-haves.
If you have the time and energy to add these things, your program will be a lot better than the average program.

The idea is that, if you don’t want to think too hard about the design of your program, you don’t have to: just follow these rules and your program will probably be good.
On the other hand, if you’ve thought about it and determined that a rule is wrong for your program, that’s fine.
(There’s no central authority that will reject your program for not following arbitrary rules.)

Also—these rules aren’t written in stone.
If you disagree with a general rule for good reason, we hope you’ll [propose a change](https://github.com/cli-guidelines/cli-guidelines).

### Distribution {#distribution}

**If possible, distribute as a single binary.**
If your language doesn’t compile to binary executables as standard, see if it has something like [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/).
If you really can’t distribute as a single binary, use the platform’s native package installer so you aren’t scattering things on disk that can’t easily be removed.
Tread lightly on the user’s computer.

If you’re making a language-specific tool, such as a code linter, then this rule doesn’t apply—it’s safe to assume the user has an interpreter for that language installed on their computer.

**Make it easy to uninstall.**
If it needs instructions, put them at the bottom of the install instructions—one of the most common times people want to uninstall software is right after installing it.
